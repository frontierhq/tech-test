This is some boilerplate command line code that is the basis for a tech test.

The test should be capped at 2 hours. If you do not finish in this time, please submit what you have done.

After you have completed the test let us or the recruiter know and we will review your code and schedule a call to discuss it.


--------
The test
--------

The first part of the test is to add a unit test for the NewRootCmd. This is a simple test that checks that the command is created correctly.

The next part of the test is to add a new command to the root command. This command should take a single argument, a string, reverse it and print it to the console. Again unit tests should be added to test this command.

Finally, another command should be added to the root command. This command should take in the name of a city and query openweathermap.org for the current weather in that city.
The command should print the current temperature in the city to the console. Unit tests should be added where possible and should be time dependant.
